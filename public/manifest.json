  "description": "Ever wondered what piece you need to tack on that endlessly growing rack of comfort cams so you can keep your super-secure top-rope on lead through that section of rattley .4s where you can't quite squeeze in a .5? Or, ever racked up with your buddy's decades old booty rack and wondered, is that nondescript piece of aluminum a Friend or a Camalot, and what's the difference anyway? If this sounds familiar, Camsizes.com can help. Compare different brands of cams by expansion range, strength, and weight. Use it to fill in gaps, or to finally figure out how a Blue Totem compares to a Blue C4 and to a Blue Metolius when that's what your random BroProj partner is carrying this week.",
